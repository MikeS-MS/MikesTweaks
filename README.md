# MikesTweaks
Mod for Lethal Company with multiple tweaks to make the game better

You will need BepinEx to use this mod, which you can check how to get and install from [here](https://www.example.com) (this message will stay here until BepinEx for Lethal Company has been released on the Thunderstore so I can add it as a dependancy and it automatically downloads)

# These are the default tweaks that are adjustable from the config file located at (GAME_DIRECTORY/BepinEx/configs/mikes.lethalcompany.mikestweaks.cfg):
## 1. Inventory slots
  - Slots Amount: 6 (was 4)
## 2. Item weights changes
  - WalkieTalkie: 0 lb (was 0 lb)
  - Flashlight: 0 lb (was 0 lb)
  - Shovel: 5 lb (was 18 lb)
  - LockPicker: 2 lb (was 15 lb)
  - ProFlashlight: 0 lb (was 5 lb)
  - StunGrenade: 2 lb (was 5 lb)
  - Boombox: 5 lb (was 15 lb)
  - TZPInhalant: 0 lb (was 0 lb)

## 3. Player Keybinds
  - Hotbar slots: 1-9 keyboard keys

## 4. Player Sprint
  - Sprint Longevity: 12 (was 5)
  - Stamina Drain from jump: 0.04 (was 0.08)
  - Default Sprint Multiplier value: 1.5 (was 1)
  - Max Sprint Multiplier Value: 3 (was 2.25)
## 5. World Time Speed
  - Speed: 0.5 (was 1)
## 6. Network additions
 - Configs are synced from Host to Client when that Client joins the lobby
 - Your Config File will not be overwritten by the sync, only the values of those in memory when the game is running.
 - The Config Values will reset to what they are in your Config File when you go back to the main menu so when you decide to host it will use your own settings instead of the ones that were synced to you from the last lobby you had joined.

 # Known Issues
 - Changing Item slots using the hotkeys does not sync the change between players, so someone might be holding one thing on your screen but they would be holding something completely different on their end.
