# Version 1.5
## IMPORTANT!
 - I've renamed a few configs so it's best to delete the config file you have and let it regenerate by launching the game and change the configs back to your liking.

**Added**
 - A config that allows you to bind the first available flashlight in your inventory to a key
 - A config that allows you to dissallow people from using the keybind if they join your lobby
 - Configs that allow you to modify Stamina Recharging

# Version 1.4.3
**Changed**
 - Fixed link in README.md to link to the correct place

# Version 1.4.2
**Added**
 - Switching between item slots will now properly sync to other players with the mod. This cannot work for people without the mod due to the original game's code
 - The Push To Talk key can be bound to mouse buttons
 
# Version 1.4
**Added**
 - Configs are now synced from Host to Client when someone joins your lobby
 - Your config values in memory load from your config file when you go back to the Main Menu so that when you host you have your own settings applied

# Version 1.3
**Added**
 - A way to bind hotbar slots (bound by default to 1-9 keys)
 - A way to bind emotes (bound by default to Y and U keys)
