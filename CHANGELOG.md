# Version 1.4.1
**Added**
 - Switching between item slots will now properly sync to other players with the mod. This cannot work for people without the mod due to the original game's code.
 
# Version 1.4
**Added**
 - Configs are now synced from Host to Client when someone joins your lobby.
 - Your config values in memory load from your config file when you go back to the Main Menu so that when you host you have your own settings applied.

# Version 1.3
**Added**
 - A way to bind hotbar slots (bound by default to 1-9 keys)
 - A way to bind emotes (bound by default to Y and U keys)

As always everything is configurable.
