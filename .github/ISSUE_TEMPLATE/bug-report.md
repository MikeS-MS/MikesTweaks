**Mods:**
```
 - Mod1 - version of Mod1 (status: enabled/disabled)
 - Mod2 - version of Mod2 (status: enabled/disabled)
```
Make sure to write down all the mods, even disabled ones, or alternatively you can send me a thunderstore/r2modman profile code, that will include all the mods you currently have in your profile.

**Configs:**
```
 Mod1:
 ChangedConfigOption1 = Value
 ChangedConfigOption2 = Value
 ...
 
 Mod2:
 ChangedConfigOption1 = Value
 ChangedConfigOption2 = Value
 ...
```
Make sure to include only the config options you've changed for each of the mods, even if they are disabled.
